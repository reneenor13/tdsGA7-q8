## Key Findings

### Quarterly Breakdown
| Quarter | Retention Rate | Change from Previous |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Q1 2024 | 71.68% | - (baseline) |

## Critical Insights

### 1. **The Q3 Crisis**
The most alarming finding is the significant 2.40 percentage point drop in Q3, representing our worst quarterly performance. This decline suggests external factors (possibly seasonal, competitive pressure, or service issues) that need immediate investigation.

### 2. **Encouraging Q4 Recovery**
Q4 showed a strong recovery with a 2.24 percentage point increase, indicating our retention strategies have potential when properly executed. This recovery signal provides a foundation for optimization.

### 3. **Consistency Challenge**
High volatility (standard deviation of 1.02%) indicates inconsistent customer experience delivery. Successful retention requires predictable, reliable service across all touchpoints.

### 4. **Revenue Impact**
Conservative estimates suggest the retention gap represents approximately **$685,000 in lost annual revenue** (assuming 10,000 customers with $500 average annual value).
